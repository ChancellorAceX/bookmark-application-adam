## Adam Brown's Bookmark Application

This is an app that allows you to add and keep track of bookmarks for various websites. 

### User Stories Completed

You can:

Add bookmarks to your bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
title
url link
description
rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app, shown in a condensed view (only showing title and rating), which may then be expanded to show additional information about that bookmark.

Detailed view expands to additionally display description, a 'Visit Site' link, an edit button, and a delete option.

The edit form allows full editing of every attribute of the given bookmark in the provided form.

You will receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark detailing the required information.

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

You may select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
